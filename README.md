# tictactoe
In this Design we have used 
**Builder Design Pattern**(in Game.java) and 
**Factory Design patterns**(in BotPlayingStrategyFactory.java) where Bot doesn't need to know the exact strategyclass to instantiate, it will just ask factory and accordingly factory class will give the applicable startegy class instance.
